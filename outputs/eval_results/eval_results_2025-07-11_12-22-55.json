    "predicted_answer": "Some mental models recommended for problem-solving are:\n\n1. First principles thinking: Deconstruct the problem into its fundamental components.\n2. Inversion: Think backwards to understand where the problem originates from.\n3. Occam's razor: Prefer simpler explanations over complex ones.\n4. Feedback loops: Understand how positive outputs can be fed back into inputs in a cycle.\n5. Leverage: Identify small decisions that can lead to significant results.",

    "question": "Summarize the concept of adaptive coherence in life management.",
    "reference_answer": "Adaptive coherence is managing life as a multi-dimensional optimisation problem under constraints like time, energy, and attention.",
    "predicted_answer": "Adaptive coherence in life management involves aligning one's actions and decisions with their core values and beliefs, while also being flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. It includes optimizing across different dimensions of life, such as internal needs and external targets, while considering constraints like time and energy. This concept emphasizes the importance of balance, control, and a harmonious integration of individualism and universalism in various life areas, such as routine activities, spare time utilization, learning, service, and new experiences.",
