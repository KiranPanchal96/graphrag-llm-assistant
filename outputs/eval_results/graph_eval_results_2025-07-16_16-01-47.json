    "reference_answer": "The purpose of life is to develop and utilise wisdom to improve oneself and the world.",
    "predicted_answer": {
      "answer": "Without a specific context provided, it is challenging to determine the life purpose described in the document. It would be helpful to have more information or specific details to provide a meaningful response.",
      "sources": []
    },
    "llm_grade": "ACCEPTABLE",
    "llm_rationale": "The predicted answer acknowledges the lack of specific context provided in the question and suggests that more information is needed to provide a meaningful response. It is relevant and addresses the limitations of the question."

    "question": "What mental models are recommended for problem solving?",
    "reference_answer": "The document suggests using ROI, first principles thinking, inversion, Occam\u2019s razor, opportunity cost, feedback loops, and leverage.",
    "predicted_answer": {
      "answer": "The document recommends using mental models such as ROI (return on investment), leverage, and feedback loops for problem solving. These models help prioritize actions that yield the greatest value for the least effort, make small decisions that lead to significant results, and continuously improve through iterative feedback processes.",
      "sources": []
    },
    "llm_grade": "ACCEPTABLE",
    "llm_rationale": "The predicted answer captures some of the recommended mental models for problem solving, such as ROI, leverage, and feedback loops. However, it does not mention first principles thinking, inversion, Occam's razor, and opportunity cost, which were also recommended in the reference answer. Additionally, the explanation could be more detailed and specific in describing how these models aid in problem solving."

    "question": "Summarize the concept of adaptive coherence in life management.",
    "reference_answer": "Adaptive coherence is managing life as a multi-dimensional optimisation problem under constraints like time, energy, and attention.",
    "predicted_answer": {
      "answer": "Adaptive coherence in life management involves optimizing across core values in a multi-dimensional way while considering constraints like time, energy, attention, and cognitive load. It emphasizes making value-aligned tradeoffs across various aspects of life to achieve a balanced and fulfilling existence.",
      "sources": []
    },
    "llm_grade": "ACCEPTABLE",
    "llm_rationale": "The predicted answer captures the essence of adaptive coherence in life management by mentioning optimizing across core values in a multi-dimensional way and considering constraints like time, energy, and attention. It also touches on making value-aligned tradeoffs. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the concept of managing life as an optimization problem and emphasizing the importance of balancing various aspects of life for a fulfilling existence."

    "question": "What is the highest return on investment (ROI) activity listed?",
    "reference_answer": "The highest ROI practices listed are exercise, AI personal project, and reading books.",
    "predicted_answer": {
      "answer": "The highest return on investment (ROI) activity listed in the context is prioritizing actions that offer the biggest value for the least effort. This approach ensures that efforts are focused on activities that yield significant results relative to the input or effort required.",

    "question": "What does Stoicism emphasize in this document?",
    "reference_answer": "Stoicism emphasizes focusing on what you can control and accepting what you cannot control.",

    "llm_grade": "ACCEPTABLE",
    "llm_rationale": "The predicted answer captures the essence of Stoicism by emphasizing the importance of focusing on what can be controlled. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the aspect of accepting what cannot be controlled, as stated in the reference answer."
